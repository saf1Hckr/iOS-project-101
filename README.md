## Notes

This app building was a little difficult as I have no previous background on Swift language but rather than it was actually a fun project. Also, selecting the logo part was hard. For the optional one of the option I could not do because I don't have an iPhone/iPad. I also use the Clideo.com for speedup my original video as the original video was too lengthy.
